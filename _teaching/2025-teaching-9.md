During **OHBM Brainhack 2025**, held from June 22 to 24, 2025, in Brisbane, Australia, I served as a tutor for a hands-on workshop session on "NeuroImaging Data Visualization with Python". This session was part of the TrainTrack program, designed to provide participants with practical skills in visualizing neuroimaging data using programming tools.

This workshop was based on the material from the following Jupyter Book on [Reproducible Pipelines for Neuroimaging Research](https://sina-mansour.github.io/ohbm2025-reproducible-research/intro.html).

Further details about the workshop can be found on the [OHBM Brainhack 2025 website](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2025/traintrack/).
