Tutoring during the [OHBM 2020 Brainhack](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/)

I tutored for the following Traintrack sessions:
* [Introduction to version control using git and github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir_ILsjkwss&feature=emb_imp_woyt)
* [Good coding practices](https://osf.io/53cte/)
* [Containerization - Docker and Singularity](https://youtu.be/pc3YOZUG3lQ)

I was also a project lead for the [Hacktrack](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/hacktrack/) project on "Prediction of age and intelligence, a basic machine learning model"
