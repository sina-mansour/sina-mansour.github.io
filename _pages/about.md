<!-- # Who am I? -->

Having completed undergraduate studies in computer sciences & electrical engineering, an interest in interdisciplinary applications of computer science encouraged my PhD studies on computational models of brain connectivity. After completing my PhD, I am continuing on a journey in exploring computational methods that enable a deeper understanding of the human brain.  I am particularly interested in the applications of concepts such as complex networks, algorithms, and machine learning in computational neuroscience. The advancement of open science initiatives and openly available neuroimaging datasets has provided abundant opportunities to build better tools to study the brain. My research aims to improve computational models that relate brain connectivity to individual differences influencing behavioral traits and psychopathologies.
