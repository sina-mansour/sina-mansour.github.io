<!-- # Who am I? -->

Having completed undergraduate studies in computer sciences & electrical engineering, an interest towards interdisciplinary applications of computer science encouraged my current PhD studies on computational models of brain connectivity. I am mainly interested in the applications of complex networks & graph algorithms in network neuroscience. The advancement of open science initiatives and openly available neuroimaging datasets has provided abundant research opportunities for computational neuroscience. My research aims to improve computational models that relate brain connectivity to individual differences influencing behavioral traits and psychopathologies.

## Research interests:

### Theory:

- Graph theory
- Network science
- Algorithms
- Machine learning
- Data mining

### Application:

- Network neuroscience
- Whole-brain connectomics
- Computational neuropsychiatry
- Normative brain connectivity
- Behavior/age prediction models
- High-resolution Connectomics
