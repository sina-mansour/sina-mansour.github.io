## Abstract:

Psychiatric symptoms in childhood and adolescence have been associated with both delayed and accelerated patterns of grey matter development. This suggests that deviation in brain structure from a normative range of variation for a given age might be important in the emergence of psychopathology. Distinct from chronological age, brain age refers to the age of an individual that is inferred from a normative model of brain structure for individuals of the same age and sex. We predicted brain age from a common set of grey matter features and examined whether the difference between an individualâ€™s chronological and brain age was associated with the severity of psychopathology in children and adolescents.
