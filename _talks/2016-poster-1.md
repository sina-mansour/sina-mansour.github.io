Emojitalianobot and EmojiWorldBot are two new online tools and digital environments for translation into emoji on Telegram, the popular instant messaging platform. Emojitalianobot is the first open and free Emoji-Italian and Emoji-English translation bot based on Unicode descriptions. The bot was designed to support the translation of Pinocchio into emoji carried out by the followers of the “Scritture brevi” blog on Twitter and contains a glossary with all the uses of emojis in the translation of the famous Italian novel. EmojiWorldBot, an off-spring project of Emojitalianobot, is a multilingual dictionary that uses Emoji as a pivot language from dozens of different languages. Currently the emoji-word and word-emoji functions are available for 72 languages imported from the Unicode tables and provide users with an easy search capability to map words in each of these languages to emojis, and vice versa. This paper presents the projects, the background and the main characteristics of these applications.
