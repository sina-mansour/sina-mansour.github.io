No two brains are alike. Neuroimaging can be used to elucidate the neural basis of human identity and to map neural correlates of human behavior and cognition. While most neuroimaging features are commonly studied in the highest resolution provided by the scanner, brain connectivity studies are traditionally conducted in a lower resolution of a predefined atlas. The aim of this study was to contrast the identification (fingerprinting) and behavior prediction capabilities of the atlas-based brain networks with a novel ultra- high-resolution model of brain networks. This comparison will explore the potential gains of conducting brain connectivity analyses in a higher resolution.
