This talk was part of the discussions around ["Mathematics of The Interactions Between Brain Structure and Brain Functions"](https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/events/mathematics-of-the-interactions-between-brain-structure-and-brain-functions/) during a two weak workshop at MATRIX house. In this presentation, I explored high-resolution connectomic approaches by examining the intersection of graph theory and neuroscience.
