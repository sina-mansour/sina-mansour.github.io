A poster presentation proposing a novel anatomically-guided cluster inference method.

This presentation proposes a novel cluster inference approach that enables enhanced sensitivity to detect anatomically interconnected brain activity patterns. The approach makes use of multimodal data acquired from diffusion imaging and task fMRI to achieve this goal. We additionally illustrate the interpretive benefits of the novel Topological Cluster Statistic (TCS) method at revealing implicated anatomical connections in a task activation.
