This webinar organised by the OHBM Australia Chapter was focused on "IMPROVED METHODS AND IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR CORRELATING BRAIN AND BEHAVIOUR".

Here, I presented our findings on the superior performance in prediction of behavioral associations from high-resolution brain connectivity models. The slides for this talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UzdTO2e91X2Tv8g2w3Qw2lwlhkIZDzQind56JYiaTuY/edit?usp=sharing).
