This short spotlight talk at the [OHBM Australia 2024 Annual Meeting](https://ohbm-aus.github.io/posts/2024-annual-meeting/) presented our recent work on spectral normative modeling for high-resolution inference of brain abnormalities. The talk highlighted the advantages of using graph spectral brain eigenmodes to create scale-independent normative models that can capture individual variations in brain structure and function across multiple spatial scales, with applications in identifying and characterizing brain abnormalities.
