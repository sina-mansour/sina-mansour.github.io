This online talk at the [MRI Together 2024 conference](https://mritogether.esmrmb.org/24m/) was part of a symposium on "Sustainable Volunteering" during which, together with Dr. Johanna Bayer we reflected on our experiences as long-term volunteers in the MRI and neuroimaging community. This talk aimed to equip attendees with practical strategies for navigating the rewards and challenges of volunteering while highlighting the lasting impact of contributing to open science and academic communities.
