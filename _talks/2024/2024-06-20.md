As the Hackathon Chair for the OHBM Open Science SIG, I had the pleasure of introducing **OHBM Brainhack 2024**, a satellite event at OHBM 2024. Together with a [team of dedicated volunteers](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2024/team/), we organized this three-day hackathon held from June 20 to 22, 2024, in Seoul, South Korea.

Hosting more than 150 participants from around the world, OHBM Brainhack 2024 provided a collaborative environment for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to work on open-science neuroimaging projects through [HackTracks](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2024/hacktrack/). Participants also benefited from hands-on workshops and tutorials in TrainTracks, as well as discussions on emerging topics and technologies during unconference sessions.

More details about OHBM Brainhack 2024 can be found on the [official website](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2024/).
