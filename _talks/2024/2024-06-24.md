As the hackathon chair for OHBM Open Science SIG, I helped organize a symposium on "Creating and using representative Big Open datasets: global challenges and promises" at OHBM 2024.

Notably, this symposium included the following four talks:

- "Global FAIR Brain Data; collaborations across high-, medium- and low-income countries" by Filima Patrick and Ebere Wogu (University of Port-Harcourt, Nigeria), Damian Eke (University of Nottingham, UK), and Franco Pestilli (Speaker, University of Texas, USA); Video available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW2Oh9lqhbE).
- "Releasing the 3R-BRAIN resource: A decade of journey to harness psychometrics for neuroscience" by Xinian Xuo (Beijing Normal University); Video available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qvoV_ypo8M).
- "UK Biobank: A Big Open dataset with global challenges and enormous promise" by Ollie Gray (UK Biobank); Video available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhmdCshWd0U).
- "Bridging Gaps in Women’s Health Research: The ENIGMA Neuroendocrinology Working Group" by Carina Heller (ENIGMA Neuroendocrinology Working Group); Video available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-E0jCmF6YI).
