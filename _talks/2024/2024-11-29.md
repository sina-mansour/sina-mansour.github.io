This virtual talk at the Melbourne Ultra-High Field Functional Imaging Network presented our recent advancements in mapping the macroscopic human brain's connectome at ultra-high resolutions. The talk discussed the challenges associated with acquiring, processing, and analyzing high-resolution neuroimaging data, as well as the promises such data hold for understanding brain organization. We also explored future prospects for integrating multi-modal imaging techniques and leveraging advanced computational models to enhance our understanding of brain connectivity and function at unprecedented spatial scales.
