A featured talk at the symposium on [*Inference on the Brain, advances and practices in brain activity inference*](https://sina-mansour.github.io/OHBM_2023/Brain_Inference_Symposium/).

This talk, provided insights on how high-resolution connectomics can enable anatomically-informed inference of brain activation.
